name: NO REMUX - Best FR Team Multi Audio (Sonarr)
description: "This profile ranks releases based on the release team and if they contains\
  \ multiple audio tracks.\n\nIt only contains french teams, so the combo french team\
  \ + multi audio gives almost every time VO audio + VFF audio.\n\nFrench teams tier\
  \ list are based on TRaSH Guides custom formats.\n\nThe worst (but still acceptable)\
  \ french team + multi audio will get higher rank than the best french team without\
  \ multi audio.\n\nIf you do not want multi audio to impact that much the score,\
  \ you can lower it lower than 100 points. This will still make multi audio beeing\
  \ picked if 2 releases have the same team tier only, but not if a better team tier\
  \ is available. \n\nThis profile does not use HDR, IMAX, Dolby Vision and other\
  \ specifications like these. It only uses teams ranks, since top tier teams deliver\
  \ good enough quality"
